# Software Testing Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **manual software testing portfolio project** created to demonstrate my software testing skills, test design approach, and understanding of QA best practices.

The application under test is **SauceDemo**, a sample e-commerce web application commonly used for testing practice.

---

## Scope of Testing
The following functional areas are covered:

- Login functionality
- Product listing and sorting
- Single product (product details) pages
- Cart functionality
- Checkout process

Testing includes:
- Functional test cases
- Positive and negative scenarios
- Boundary and validation checks where applicable

---

## Test Artifacts
This repository includes the following test artifacts:

### Test Plan
- Defines test strategy
- Scope
- Risks
- Test environment
- Entry and exit criteria

### Test Cases
Test cases are created and executed in **Excel files**, organized by functional area:

- Login
- Products
- Cart
- Checkout

Each test case includes:
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results
- Execution status

---

## Test Approach
- Test cases are organized by **business functionality**, not UI location
- Both happy path and negative scenarios are covered
- Focus is on realistic user behavior and risk-based testing
- Exploratory testing ideas are considered but not fully executed in this phase

---

## Tools Used
- Manual testing techniques
- Microsoft Excel (test case design and execution)
- GitHub (version control and documentation)

---

## Limitations & Future Improvements
This project currently focuses on **manual testing only**.

Possible future improvements include:
- Test automation (e.g. Selenium or Playwright)
- API testing
- Performance testing
- Defect tracking using a dedicated tool (e.g. Jira)

Test coverage was intentionally limited to representative scenarios to focus on **test design quality rather than quantity**.
